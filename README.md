Methode De Beer for axial capacity of piles according to Belgian practice
============================================================================

This package is an open-source Python implementation of the axial bearing capacity
calculation of driven piles according to Belgian practice (methode De Beer).
The method builds on similitude between a cone penetration test and axial loading
of a pile to propose an algorithm for deriving unit base resistance.

Quick start
-----------

1. Clone to source code or download it from Github

2. For novice users, installing Python 3.7 using Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is recommended.
The Anaconda installation immediately takes care of the required dependencies (Numpy, Scipy and Pandas).

3. Run `python setup.py install` to install the package.

4. Jupyter notebooks with the benchmark calculations provided by BGGG are included in the `examples` folder.
You can download and run these to check the working of the method.
