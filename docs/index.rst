Welcome to methodedebeer documentation!
====================================================================

This Python package contains the code for calculation of piles according to Belgian practice.

This package is developed to allow students to quickly get started with axial pile calculation and to serve as
a basis for co-creation around geotechnics in Belgium.

This package is under development so any request for additional functionality can always be submitted
to the package author.


Installation requirements

methodedebeer is written for Python 3.7. Downloading Anaconda3 is recommended for users not familiar with Python development.
